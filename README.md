## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

### Screenshot

## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocesser

### What I learned

This is a quite large project so it is all of my tools coming into one. Everything is happening quickly so the project should be done within the week.


### Continued development

Learning more of the SASS syntax and utilizing different ideas. Learning how to structure SASS files along with the way partials work is the next few steps in this development. 

Due to it being a large project handling the code base is the biggest management issue for my now but for now it has been very simple and will most likely stay as manageable as it is right now.
